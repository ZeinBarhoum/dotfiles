# Scripts

Script files I created to automate some parts of my system

- `set_bing_wallpaper`: a script to set the wallpaper to the current Bing wallpaper, saves it to "$HOME/Pictures/wallpapers" and use feh to set it as wallpaper.
- `x-terminal-emulator`: a script that invoke kitty whenever x-terminal-emulator is called (for example, when isaac-lab opens its terminal)
- `keyboard-layouts`: a script to set the keyboard layout to my preference and runs kbdd as well.
